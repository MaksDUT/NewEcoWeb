# EcoWeb

This project is intended to be the support of our work for a university project during our last year of engineering.

Nowadays, ecology has become a very important issue for students. They are educated from the beginning of their schooling about the dangers and consequences of climate change, and learn actions to limit their own pollution. However, in a world where computer science plays such an important role, eco-actions to address this type of pollution are rare (even though 94% of 15-29 year olds own a smartphone!). 

Our team, Uni Green, has therefore had as a project to raise awareness among students about the pollution caused by computer equipment; with the ultimate goal of teaching them to reduce their carbon footprint by using the equipment they have more efficiently.
